# Changelog

All notable changes to `shinka-evolve` are documented in this file.

## TBD

### Added

- Added native Google Gemini 3.7 Flash support at its introductory 2026 price.
- Added native Google Gemini 3.6 Flash support with current pricing and
  level-based thinking controls. Thanks @anantgar.
- Added optional Weights & Biases logging with resumable run IDs, per-individual
  scores, timing and cost metrics, and final run summaries in PR #149. PR #177
  adds monotonic population/island snapshots and a secured metadata boundary.
  Thanks @anantgar.
- Added Verilog/SystemVerilog as a first-class evolution target in PR #137,
  including `.sv` task detection, syntax validation, EVOLVE-BLOCK marker support,
  failure-artifact rendering, and a self-contained RTLLM example. Thanks @Tyronita.
- Added startup pricing refresh from models.dev with conditional HTTP caching,
  validated offline fallback, provider-qualified model discovery, and per-run
  pricing snapshots in PR #141. The tutorial now includes a no-cost catalog
  preflight. Thanks @rodmarkun.
- Added DeepSeek V4 Flash and V4 Pro pricing entries to the DeepSeek LLM pricing catalog.
- Added controls to reduce evaluation stdout bloat: `JobConfig.eval_verbose` suppresses framework evaluation progress output, and `DatabaseConfig.max_stdout_log_chars` can persist only the tail of `stdout_log` metadata while keeping full logs on disk. Thanks @marcopirazzini.
- Added SLURM support for `numeric_threads_per_job`, applying numeric-library thread caps consistently across local and SLURM evaluation jobs. Thanks @marcopirazzini.

### Changed

- Reduced Python complexity-analysis overhead by parsing each candidate AST once
  while preserving the existing metrics contract. Thanks @dexhunter.
- Relaxed the exact HTTPX dependency pin to a `>=0.27` compatibility lower
  bound in issue #180. Thanks @htmai-880.
- Removed the automatic Claude Code Review pull-request workflow.

### Fixed

- Fixed diff insertions (empty SEARCH blocks) splicing the payload directly
  against the EVOLVE-BLOCK-END marker, which corrupted the marker line, let
  consecutive insertions merge code lines into invalid programs, and caused
  marker validation to reject every insertion patch for block-comment
  languages such as Wolfram. Reported in issue #183. Thanks
  @Atharva-Kanherkar.
- Fixed Gemini retry handling so unsupported structured-output requests fail
  immediately, synchronous retries are paced, and sync/async calls share the
  same default thinking budget.
- Fixed Rust candidate validation on stable toolchains by replacing the
  nightly-only parser flag with isolated, non-mutating `rustfmt` syntax checks
  in PR #179. Thanks @Atharva-Kanherkar.
- Fixed Azure OpenAI LLM client construction to use the v1 base URL contract,
  avoiding doubled `/openai/v1/openai` request paths and 404 responses reported
  in issue #147.
- Fixed OpenAI retry handling so ShinkaEvolve respects provider `retry_after` hints from transient Cloudflare/API 5xx responses.
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 kwargs so ShinkaEvolve omits `temperature` for thinking-mode calls and includes model kwargs in retry error logs.
- Fixed Claude Opus 4.8 kwargs so ShinkaEvolve omits the deprecated `temperature` parameter for Anthropic and Bedrock calls.
- Fixed OpenAI reasoning model kwargs so ShinkaEvolve omits the deprecated `temperature` parameter for GPT-5-series Responses API calls.
- Fixed DeepSeek reasoning model kwargs so ShinkaEvolve passes DeepSeek thinking-mode controls and `reasoning_effort` for V4 models.
- Fixed Google GenAI client setup to detect broken IPv6 connectivity to Google API hosts and prefer IPv4 when needed.
- Fixed LLM pricing boolean metadata normalization so reasoning-model flags handle whitespace and mixed CSV value types.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses parsing to find assistant text by content type while ignoring reasoning/tool text when no message output exists.
- Fixed quiet evaluation mode so `run_shinka_eval(..., verbose=False)` also suppresses result-save framework stdout while preserving the default verbose behavior.

## 0.0.7 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added Gemini 3.5 Flash pricing to the Google LLM pricing catalog.
- Added Claude Opus 4.8 pricing entries for the Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock (`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`) in the LLM pricing catalog.
- Added Wolfram Language as a first-class evolution target: registry entries (`wolfram`, `wl`, `wls`, `mathematica`), code-fence and EVOLVE-BLOCK marker support, and end-to-end coverage in `apply_diff` / `apply_full`.
- Added EVOLVE-BLOCK marker validation in `shinka.edit.marker_validation`, catching the LLM failure mode where a block-comment-language marker is emitted without its closing delimiter (Wolfram, Markdown), which would silently trap the candidate body inside a comment.
- Added the `examples/wolfram_gcd_sum` task: deoptimized seed for `S(N) = sum_{i,j in 1..N} GCD(i,j)`. The evaluator calibrates the baseline on every run by timing the seed through the same `RepeatedTiming` harness as the candidate, and the Wolfram-side timeout is configurable via `WOLFRAM_GCD_MAX_SECONDS`.
- Added Go as a first-class evolution target with `go`/`golang` language registration, `.go` task detection, WebUI failure-artifact support, regression coverage, and the `examples/go_collatz_steps` task.

### Fixed

- Fixed the WebUI dashboard so runs that have completed only the initial generation remain visible instead of being filtered out as empty results.
- Fixed the WebUI Ensembling tab so single-model Headless runs render visible data points and keep the top y-axis tick labels in view.

## 0.0.6 - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added Headless CLI-backed LLM provider support via `headless/<agent>` model strings, defaulting to `npx -y @roberttlange/headless` for subscription-backed Codex, Claude, and other local agent calls.
- Added Headless startup validation, prompt artifacts, usage/cost parsing, and a `examples/sine_approx_headless` task showing API-free mutation calls with embeddings disabled.
- Added Vertex AI authentication support for Gemini LLM and embedding clients in PR #125. Thanks @wu375.
- Added async-runner validation for configured LLM and embedding model environment access before run artifacts are created in PR #127. Thanks @RobertTLange.
- Added GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.5 Pro entries to the OpenAI LLM pricing catalog.
- Added Fortran evolution support, including language detection, patch application, validation, visualization metadata, and a compiled heat-diffusion example in PR #131.

### Fixed

- Fixed bandit sampler resume from legacy or changed `llm_models` state so saved per-arm arrays are resized, name-aligned when possible, and cost-aware UCB range state remains active after loading `bandit_state.pkl` in PR #130, addressing issue #129.
- Fixed the WebUI embedding similarity heatmap so hydrated programs with empty embeddings no longer leave the tab stuck on `Loading full embedding data...`, and stale cached full-program data is refetched after summary updates.

## 0.0.5 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added the GitHub Pages documentation website for `shinka-evolve`.
- Added interactive async-throughput and UCB bandit-selection demos to the documentation website.
- Added dashboard sorting controls to the local WebUI so result cards can be reordered by the active setting.
- Added a `Hide Plot` / `Show Plot` toggle for the WebUI Throughput tab runtime timeline while keeping the plot visible by default.
- Added Claude Opus 4.7 pricing entries for the Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`) in the LLM pricing catalog.

### Changed

- Changed `shinka_run` startup output to use a minimal `Shinka CLI` banner while other launch paths keep the full gradient banner.
- Changed `enable_controlled_oversubscription` to default to `false` across the shared `EvolutionConfig` baseline and packaged Hydra evolution presets.
- Changed the WebUI meta header to show the active results directory directly in the info panel.
- Changed the WebUI Throughput tab runtime timeline to scale its height with worker-lane count so each worker keeps a dedicated visible row.

### Fixed

- Fixed async run-time regressions from proposal-failure persistence by keeping terminal failed proposals in `attempt_log` plus `failure.json` artifacts instead of inserting them into the main `programs` table during evolution runs.
- Fixed the local WebUI to render failed proposal nodes from `attempt_log` plus `failure.json` so failure lineage remains visible without storing synthetic failed programs in the main results database.
- Fixed failed terminal proposal and prompt-evolution cost accounting so the runtime API budget counter now reflects those spend buckets, and added runtime-timeline metadata for failed proposal nodes rendered from `attempt_log`.
- Fixed bandit summary tables to preserve readable `local/<model>` and `openrouter/<model>` labels while stripping endpoint and API-key query details from local OpenAI-compatible model labels.
- Fixed the LLM bandit sampling summary to use the same 120-column table width as the program, patch, and other Rich summaries.
- Fixed the default `AsymmetricUCB` bandit summary to omit the `div` and `log mean` columns for a more compact Rich table.
- Fixed the compare view so negative best scores remain visible instead of being clamped away by the WebUI summary logic.
- Fixed documentation links and metadata URLs to use the deployed GitHub Pages path capitalization (`/ShinkaEvolve/`).
- Fixed oversubscription regression coverage and docs so adaptive proposal backlog behavior is now clearly opt-in instead of implied by defaults.
- Fixed Gemini client timeout handling so the shared second-based timeout is converted to the millisecond unit expected by `google-genai`, avoiding accidental `1.2s` read timeouts on long-running requests.
- Fixed async runtime regressions from sampling/evaluation worker-lane persistence by falling back to timestamp-based throughput lane inference instead of storing those lane IDs in program metadata.
- Fixed local WebUI cache staleness by disabling browser caching for the main HTML shells (`index.html`, `viz_tree.html`, `compare.html`) served by the local visualization server.
- Fixed WebUI Throughput tab hydration so `right_tab=throughput` restores reliably after data loads and the generation runtime timeline renders pool stages using timestamp-inferred sampling/evaluation lanes on the current Plotly build.

## 0.0.4 - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Added a new `shinka_models` CLI that inspects the current environment plus discovered `.env` files and reports which priced LLM and embedding models are available to use.
- Added per-model `api_key_env` support for local OpenAI-compatible LLM and embedding backends, allowing credentials to be selected inline via `local/<model>@http(s)://...?...api_key_env=ENV_VAR`.

### Changed

- Changed `shinka_models` default output to a compact JSON object with separate `embedding` and `llm` model lists, while `--verbose` now emits provider-level availability details with the same top-level lists.
- Updated the `shinka-run` skill so run planning must validate mutation, meta-recommendation, prompt-evolution, and embedding models against `shinka_models` before launching evolution.
- Improved local async runtime scaling by launching evaluation subprocesses with the active project interpreter, capping per-process numeric-library thread fan-out, and reducing local monitor polling latency.
- Moved prompt-fitness percentile recomputation off the prompt side-effect hot path and onto a debounced background task using fresh read-only database connections.
- Updated the circle-packing scaling presets to run for `100` generations and reduced `max_patch_resamples` to `1` for the small / medium / large benchmark configs.

### Fixed

- Fixed adaptive proposal targeting so invalid `proposal_target_hard_cap` values below evaluation capacity no longer silently disable oversubscription.
- Fixed prompt-percentile background refresh to avoid SQLite thread-affinity failures when recomputing prompt fitness during async runs.
- Fixed Windows Unicode handling for async candidate-file I/O, diff summaries, and best-path exports by forcing UTF-8 reads and writes on LLM-generated artifacts.

## 0.0.3 - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Added local OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint support via `evo.embedding_model=local/<model>@http(s)://host[:port]/v1`.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` plus GitHub issue and pull-request templates to document the contribution flow.
- Added Python throughput plotting utilities in `shinka.plots` for generation runtime timelines and normalized occupancy-over-time views.
- Added a durable SQLite `generation_event_log` journal for async generation lifecycle debugging, including stop and persistence-failure events.
- Added regression coverage for the new Python throughput plotting helpers, including pool-slot prep, occupancy math, and legend/layout behavior.
- Added regression coverage for concurrent async completed-job persistence so multi-worker postprocessing throughput stays exercised.
- Added regression coverage for lightweight program summaries and WebUI embed-tab hydration so similarity matrices only render from fully loaded embedding data.

### Changed

- Reworked async completion handling so completed scheduler jobs are detected immediately, evaluation slots are released before persistence finishes, and shutdown now waits for queued completed-job batches plus post-persistence side effects to drain.
- Moved database archive / best-program / island maintenance off the insert hot path via deferred replay hooks, while letting async writers use fresh worker-local connections and merge runtime metadata back into the shared DB state.
- Expanded pipeline timing metadata with post-evaluation queue wait, post-persistence side-effect timing, and summary statistics for end-to-end async throughput analysis.
- Tuned `examples/circle_packing/shinka_long.yaml` for a smaller long-run preset and ignored generated `results*` / `shinka_scale*` artifacts in the repo root.
- Renamed the local backend guide from `docs/support_local_llm.md` to `docs/support_local_models.md` and expanded it to cover local embedding backends alongside local LLMs.
- Refactored async code validation to use a shared subprocess helper across Python, Rust, Swift, JSON, and C++ validators without changing validation behavior.
- Updated `examples/circle_packing/load_results.ipynb` to include the new throughput plots at the bottom of the notebook.
- Updated `examples/circle_packing/load_results.ipynb` and `examples/circle_packing/shinka_long.yaml` for the latest large async circle-packing run analysis setup.
- Refined Python throughput plot legends to use compact centered panels below each subplot for cleaner notebook rendering.
- Reduced the async generation journal to high-signal failure/stop events only so persistence debugging does not add heavy hot-path overhead.

### Fixed

- Fixed completion-time accounting so retried or duplicate-persisted jobs keep the original scheduler completion timestamp instead of inflating evaluation duration.
- Fixed the async job monitor to finalize cleanly once the generation target is reached, even when no jobs remain active at the polling boundary.
- Fixed high-concurrency SQLite persistence regressions by covering deferred maintenance replay, multi-writer overlap, and shutdown drain behavior with new recovery and database tests.
- Fixed async proposal scheduling so `num_generations` is now a hard cap on assigned proposal generations instead of launching extra `gen_*` attempts to compensate for failed or discarded work.
- Fixed async evaluation slot lifecycle bugs so local evaluation concurrency no longer exceeds `max_evaluation_jobs` through stale double-release of reassigned worker slots.
- Fixed retry-time completion accounting so successful DB retries refresh async progress before the hard generation-budget stop condition is evaluated.
- Fixed async database retry races by treating in-flight `source_job_id` inserts as already claimed, preventing duplicate persisted programs while timed-out writes are still finishing in worker threads.
- Fixed async resume/recovery bookkeeping so restarted runs continue from the number of persisted completed programs instead of stopping early when failed proposals or hung local evals left gaps in generation IDs.
- Fixed WebUI meta-analysis labeling so `meta_*.txt` snapshots are presented as meta updates / processed-count checkpoints instead of misleading generation numbers.
- Fixed duplicate-retry recovery so already-persisted jobs replay post-persistence side effects exactly once, restoring missing meta-memory updates after DB timeouts.
- Fixed SQLite persistence stability by increasing busy timeouts and the outer async DB-add timeout for long high-concurrency runs.
- Fixed Python throughput plot preparation so frames without optional metadata columns like `is_island_copy`, `patch_name`, or `model_name` still render correctly.
- Fixed legacy throughput accounting in both the Python plotter and WebUI Throughput tab so reused worker lanes no longer show impossible peaks like `31/20`.
- Fixed the WebUI embed tab so summary-only loads or single lazily hydrated programs no longer produce a misleading 1x1 similarity matrix instead of the full run.

## 0.0.2 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Added adaptive proposal oversubscription controls and documentation for bounded async proposal backlogs.
- Added a new `Throughput` tab in the WebUI with runtime timeline, worker occupancy, normalized occupancy, occupancy distribution, completion-rate, and utilization summaries.
- Added regression coverage for WebUI runtime timeline and Throughput-tab structure.

### Changed

- Improved async runtime accounting so evaluation timing starts at evaluation-slot acquisition instead of scheduler submission.
- Improved runtime timeline rendering in the WebUI, including better legend placement and spawned-island copy deduplication for resource-usage plots.
- Improved the embedding similarity matrix layout so large runs preserve cell size and scroll cleanly instead of collapsing visually.
- Expanded `docs/async_evolution.md` with detailed explanations of controlled oversubscription settings and tuning heuristics.

### Fixed

- Prevented duplicate async program persistence for the same completed scheduler job by treating `source_job_id` writes as idempotent.
- Fixed inflated runtime timeline peaks caused by counting spawned-island copies as separate runtime jobs.
- Fixed runtime timeline legend overlap and related layout issues in the WebUI.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-03-12

First PyPI release for `shinka-evolve`.

### Added

- Initial PyPI release for `shinka-evolve`.
- Trusted publishing workflow via GitHub Actions.
- Packaged Hydra presets and release artifact checks for PyPI builds.
- Added a full async pipeline via `ShinkaEvolveRunner` for concurrent proposal generation and evaluation.
- Added prompt co-evolution support, including a system-prompt archive, prompt mutation, and prompt fitness tracking.
- Added island sampling strategies via `shinka/database/island_sampler.py` (`uniform`, `equal`, `proportional`, `weighted`).
- Added fix-mode prompts for incorrect-only populations.
- Added new plotting modules:
  - `shinka/plots/plot_costs.py`
  - `shinka/plots/plot_evals.py`
  - `shinka/plots/plot_time.py`
  - `shinka/plots/plot_llm.py`
- Added new documentation:
  - `docs/async_evolution.md`
  - `docs/design/dynamic_evolve_markers.md`
  - `docs/design/evaluation_cascades.md`
- Added the `examples/game_2048` example.

### Changed

- Refactored the API around `ShinkaEvolveRunner` and the async evolution pipeline.
- Added prompt co-evolution, expanded island logic, provider-based LLM and embedding modules, and a major WebUI refresh.
- Preserved original shorthand launch syntax such as `variant=...`, `task=...`, `database=...`, and `cluster=...`.
- Expanded island and parent sampling logic, including dynamic island spawning on stagnation.
- Refactored the LLM and embedding stack into provider-based modules.
- `ShinkaEvolveRunner` gained stronger resume behavior, fix-mode sampling fallback, and richer metadata/cost accounting.
- Database model expanded with dynamic island spawning controls, island selection strategy config, and `system_prompt_id` lineage.
- `shinka/core/wrap_eval.py` gained per-run process parallelism, deterministic ordering, clearer worker error surfacing, early stopping, optional plot artifacts, and NaN/Inf score guards.
- WebUI backend/frontend expanded with summary/count/details/prompts/stats/plots endpoints plus dashboard and compare views.
- README and install docs were updated to prefer PyPI install and document `--config-dir` for user-defined presets.
- `pyproject.toml` packaging/dependency updates:
  - `google-generativeai` -> `google-genai`
  - added `psutil`
  - pinned `httpx==0.27`
  - updated setuptools packaging config

### Cost Budgeting

- `max_api_costs` became a first-class runtime budget guard in evolution runners.
- Budget checks use committed cost:
  - realized DB costs (`api_costs`, `embed_cost`, `novelty_cost`, `meta_cost`)
  - plus estimated cost of in-flight work
- Once the budget is reached, new proposals stop and the runner drains ongoing jobs.
- If `num_generations` is omitted, `max_api_costs` is required to bound the run.
